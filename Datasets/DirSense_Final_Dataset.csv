"Vikram walks 5 km west to reach a bus stop. After 2 km, he remembers he has to buy tickets before arriving at the bus stop. The ticket counter is 1 km north and 1 km east of his current position. After buying the tickets, he continues to the bus stop.Distance from starting point ?","Starting from home and facing the 9 o’clock direction, Vikram begins his walk. After covering 2 km forward, he recalls the ticket errand.
